            experience for a beach staycation. Everyone can pamper all day by
            dipping into their cold swimming pool.While soaking in the pool, you
            will be treated with a wide expanse of a panoramic sea view and the
            horizon.

              What an unforgettable experience! The place was so great and had an amazing ambiance. 
              Very aesthetic and clean. The staff were very welcoming and approachable. And the food
              was superbly delicious. For me, it's 1000/10 I highly recommend this resort to everyone.

              Thank you so much, Matahom, for letting us experience your unwavering service. One of the 
              best resorts in Cebu, indeed!
