            <b>LOOK: </b>The famous "Aisle of Medellin" in the town of Medellin
            in northern Cebu Looks like a location straight out of a Korean film
            as "Bugang" in Bisaya is seen all over the vast sugarcane plantation
            in the area. It has since become a go-to place for riders all over
            the province.| Photos from Jack Ponpon via Immae Lachic

            On the months of September and October, tassels of tiny white
            flowers develop at the upper end of the sugarcane stalks which
            herald their harvest season. Seen from above, these flowers appear
            to be like cotton balls scattered across the vast sugarcane fields
            in Medellin, Cebu. üåæ Tag someone you want to walk here with!

              Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing
              that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. All of
              the people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and
              advice. We travelled with two six year olds and lots of luggage
              and despite the stairs up to the elevator this was one of the
              nicest places we stayed in the four weeks we were in Europe.
